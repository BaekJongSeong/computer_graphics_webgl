<font size="5em" color="yellow">
welcome. This is a general lecture on Webgl. <br/>We're going to take and explain topic with great visual impact. <br/>Each topic is explained, followed by summary quiz. Let's start!</font><br/>
<img src="555.jpg" alt="My Image" width="800" height="400"><hr>
	<h2><font size="6em" color="yellow">Primitive Assembly</h2></font>
<font size="5em" color="white">
There are three types of primitive assemblies. They are points, lines and triangles.<br/>
In My webgl course, you can view and compare 5 current points, line , triangle , triangle fan and triangle strip at the same time.<br/>
Based on the vertex, the point is marked at the corresponding vertex position, and the point size has been adjusted to a visible size. <br/>A line is a line composed of two vertices, and line strip and line loop functions exist. <br/>The line itself is a property that connects two different vertices, <br/>and the line strip continuously overlaps one vertex, and in the line loop, the last vertex meets the first vertex again to form a loop. <br/>The three-dimensional line you can see here is a general line.<br/>
Triangle is also divided into 3 parts. They are Triangles , triangle_fan , triangle_strip . <br/>Triangles connect 3 different points, triangle_fan centers on one point, <br/>and this point becomes a part of all vertices of the remaining triangles.<br/> In triangle_strip, vertices are continuously overlapped like a line strip and triangles are connected.</font>
<br/><br/><font size="5em" color="yellow">Quiz1: Check the toggle animation checkbox. For 5 three-dimensional figures, <br/>can you tell which draw_mode was used among the above 5 modes? <br/>Probably, I think, it's not easy yet. Let's keep learning!</font>
<hr>
	<h2><font size="6em" color="yellow">Translate</h2></font>
<font size="5em" color="white">
The next topic is translate! The key to Translate is the movement of points, not movement of figures.</br> The keyword of shifting the origin point is at the heart of this topic. </br> So, when translate and rotate are used together, the plane itself rotates after the origin point is moved. </br> Remind yourself of what you learned in postscript.
Check the toggle animation checkbox. </br> How are the currently rotating 5 cubes made? The answer is translate.</br>  With the object in the center, I went through 4 translates to complete the shape of 5 cubes. </br> At this point, be careful when performing the next translate because once the translate is executed, </br> the changed position is considered the origin point!! </br> (The current position should be the origin and computed.) It can be turned on and off via .</br>
Also, the original size cube in the center  created a smaller size cube(inside). </br>I did it with the scale function, try spinning the rotation on/off through the button below</font></br></br> 
<label>spinning smallest_center_cube off/on : </label> 
	<button onclick="spinning_on()"> on </button>
	<button onclick="spinning_off()"> off </button>
<br/><hr>
	Think about why there are 0 vertex(the number of vertices is zero) and 1 cube left??????
	<br/> HINT: How can we make z-fight in our code? remind it
	<br/><label>number of vertices (0~36)</label>
	<input style="width:200px" type="range" min="0" max="36" value="36"
	        oninput="num_vertex = this.value ;"></input>

	<button onclick="Translate4_on()"> on </button>
	<button onclick="Translate4_off()"> off </button>
	<br/><br/><br/><hr>
<font size="5em" color="yellow">
Quiz2: Adjust the number of vertices. Can you see the difference?? </br>Number of vertices controls the number of vertices so that only a certain number of vertices are left before rendering. </br>Then, even if you make a cube with 36 vertices, some vertices will be ignored. </br>At this time, do you know why the cube remains in the middle even though the number of vertices is set to 0? The next topic will explain why.</font>

<hr>
	<h2><font size="6em" color="yellow">Depth test</h2></font>
<font size="5em" color="white">
The next topic is depth test. So far, no z-fighting is taking place. </br>Because I didn't turn on depth test. Z-fighting is a phenomenon that occurs because different objects have the same z depth </br>value and different pictures are drawn at the same time at the depth location where one should be drawn. </br>Shall we turn on the depth test? You can clearly see the z-fighting phenomenon in the center cube.</br> At this time, the depth test is where the objects to be drawn continue to pile up, and at this time, </br>it plays a role in distinguishing the relationship between the objects after standing. </br>If you turn on the depth test, you should see only one cube face in the center, but a face with two colors is visible.</br> It looks like both sides are visible at the same time. This is proof that z-fighting is here now. </br> 
<img src="33.jpg" alt="My Image" width=800" height="200">
</br>At this time, try to adjust the f and u values. In order to eliminate the z-fighting phenomenon,</br> you need to adjust the f and u values ​​(called polygon offset) to divide the precedence relationship </br>at a specific z position where z-fighting occurs. In this case, this relationship is not reflected in the overall depth.</font></br></br> 

<br/><br/><br/><hr>
	<input type="checkbox" onclick="fn_toggle(2929)"><label>DEPTH_TEST</label> 
#############YOUR CHALLENGE: choose perfect f,u to remove all z-fight:##############
	<br/>polygonOffset (factor, units) : </label> 
	<label> F </label><input id="offset_f" type="text" size="4" value="0">
	<label> U </label><input id="offset_u" type="text" size="4" value="0">
	<button onclick="fn_polygonOffset()">Set</button>
	<br/>IF z-fight of the cube(one of them(in edge side)) still remain, think about reason why??? 
	<br/>HINT: think about cube with draw_mode TRIANGLE_FAN<hr><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<font size="5em" color="yellow">
This is the answer to the first quiz. Previously, it was difficult to distinguish objects </br> because the depth test was not turned on, so I could not see the appearance,</br>  but now I think I can distinguish strips and lines by looking at the appearance of objects through the depth test.</br> </br> 
This is the answer to the second quiz. In order for Z-fighting to happen, </br> you basically have to put two objects on top of each other in about the same position. </br> This will cause them to fight each other at the z depth location. </br> So, since two cubes are drawn, this phenomenon occurs because there is a cube </br> that is normally affected by the number of vertices and a cube that is not affected by the number of vertices.</br> </br> 

#Quiz3 : YOUR CHALLENGE: choose perfect f,u to remove all z-fight</br> 
IF z-fight of the cube(one of them(in edge side)) still remain, think about reason why???</br> 
HINT: think about cube with draw_mode TRIANGLE_FAN</font>

	<h2><font size="6em" color="yellow">lookat && FOV(field of view)</h2></font>
<font size="5em" color="white">
The next topic is lookat and field of view (FOV). The original object lies at position (0,0,0). </br> And the camera looking at the object is displayed as if it is inside the object, so the camera is not positioned properly. </br> So we have to set the origin (0,0,0) as the position of the camera, and move the object back/forward that much </br> so that the camera at the origin is facing the object! The lookat function has important parameters such as eye, center, and up. </br> First we need to specify the up vector. This is a normal vector for the camera!! </br> For convenience, I will set it to [0,1,0]. (For the direction of the camera) </br> And the center can be expressed as a vector where the object is located.</br>  Eye is where the camera is!! Now try pressing the auto and + - buttons in the place called move your cam. </br> The position of the camera will change (in the y-axis direction).</br> 
<img src="44.jpg" alt="My Image" width=800" height="300"></br> 
<br/><br/>
    <label>FOV : </label>
    <input style="width:400px" id="fov_range" type="range" min="10" max="170" value="90" oninput="fn_update_fov(this.value);"></input>
	<input style="width:60px" type="text" id="textFOV" value="90">
	<br/>
<label>move your cam until -3.0 < cam_y < 3.0:</label> 
	<button onclick="cam_y_plus()"> + </button>
	<button onclick="cam_y_minus()"> - </button>
	<button onclick="cam_y_plus_auto()"> auto + </button>
	<button onclick="cam_y_minus_auto()"> auto - </button>
	<br/><br/>
And FOV, short for field of view, adjusts the focal length of the camera to determine whether the camera sees a wide or narrow area. </br> FOV is currently adjusted from 0 to 170. Try it yourself!</font>

	<h2><font size="6em" color="yellow">shading</h2></font>
<font size="5em" color="white">
The last topic is light position in shading. We learned about one of the lighting models, the phong model. </br> It is divided into diffuse light, specular light and ambient light. Cosine value is used when calculating diffuse light. </br> (The overall appearance is structrued.) The specular light changes as it moves relative to the object while only certain parts are very bright. </br> These three lights can be expressed in RGB. </br> Currently, we have created a button for what happens when you adjust the position of all lights (without dividing each light separately).</font></br> </br><br/><br/>
		<label>Light Position X,Y,Z (-4 ~ +4)</label>
		<input style="width:200px" type="range" min="-100" max="100" value="0" 
	        oninput="light_posx = this.value/25 ;"></input>
		<input style="width:200px" type="range" min="-100" max="100" value="0" 
	        oninput="light_posy = this.value/25 ;"></input>
		<input style="width:200px" type="range" min="-100" max="100" value="0" 
	        oninput="light_posz = this.value/25 ;"></input>
	<br/><br/><br/>
<font size="5em" color="yellow">
 Quiz4: Try adjusting each bar for the light position x y z.</br>  If you go in one direction, the light moves closer to the object, and if you go in the opposite direction, the light moves away? </br> no. Since this light moves according to the coordinates as if we put the camera or object on the coordinates, </br> only when the object moves in the direction the light approaches the light and the light moves away from the rest. Check it out for yourself!</font>
